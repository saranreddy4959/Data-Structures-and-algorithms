Here first we check for the conditions if a number is equal to 0 or 1
if it is  not then we check by assigning start with 0 and end with the number.
Now, using while loop where start is smaller than or eaula to end .Compute avg as start+end//2. now compare avg*avg with the number if it is equal to the number we should return it

else if number is greater, do binary search between mid+1 and end.In this case,we also update result.
else if number is smaller do the binary search between start and mid.


time complexity:O(logn)
Space complexity:O(1)
