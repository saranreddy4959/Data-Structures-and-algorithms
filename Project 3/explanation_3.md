First i have sorted the list in descending order then I have taken two empty strings 
After that i will iterate the list using indexing if index is an even number i will add it to the string if it is an odd i will add it to another string.Finally I appended the two strings into a list

time complexity:O(nlogn) as I have used sorted function
Space Complexity:O(n) as I have created a string
