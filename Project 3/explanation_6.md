First, I have taken two variables min and max and assigned it to None
Next, I have iterated the list so that and if min and  max are none i have assigned the first element in a list to the min and max
after that the next element which comes in the iteration i will be checking this with both min and max using conditions 
Finally I will return the min and max values

Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:O(n) as i have taken two variables for min and max
