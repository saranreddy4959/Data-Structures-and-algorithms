First I have initialised low and mid values as zero and I have taken high as number of elements in the list 
using while loop for the condition mid is less than or equal to high
if list[mid] is zero swap list[low] and list[mid] and also increment the lo+ and mid+
else if list[mid] is one increment the mid
else list[mid] is blue we should then swap the list[mid] and list[high] also decrement the high value high--

Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:0(1)
